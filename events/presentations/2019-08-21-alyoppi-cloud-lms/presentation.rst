Lot of challenges
=================

So how do we can make a software to solve all of these needs?

----

:data-rotate: r90
:data-x: r800
:data-y: r800

1. **Platform to provide robustness and scale**
2. Software design to support scale and extensibility
3. DevOps to course material production
4. Tools and automation to support IT operations

Short history of platforms
==========================

----

:data-y: r0
:data-x: r-300

Bare-metal:

* good: dedicated resources, speed, easy to understand and operate
* bad: maintenance, no redundancy, power outages, requires knowledge, vertical scaling has a limit

----

:data-x: r-50

Virtual machines:

* good: maintenance is better than with bare-metal,
  can be migrated online, backups,
  easy to deploy multiple versions
* bad: where developer ends and IT operator starts,
  requires lot of system administration (software upgrades, Ansible, Puppet),
  scaling is often done manually

----

Containers:

* good: developer provides full OS environment with the app,
  service components (Web, DB, FS) can split to different containers,
  scaling can often be automatic
* bad: managing the complexity is hard,
  security updates to environment,
  git clone + django migrate is not enough!

----

:data-x: r-600

Brief history..
===============

* Unix V7 introduced ``chroot`` in 1979 (`article <https://blog.aquasec.com/a-brief-history-of-containers-from-1970s-chroot-to-docker-2016>`_)

* Solaris Containers released in Solaris 10, 2004

* *"Starting in Linux 3.8 (Feb 18, 2013), unprivileged processes can create user namespaces,
  which opens up a raft of interesting new possibilities for applications"*
  (`lwn.net <https://lwn.net/Articles/531114/>`_)

* Docker was released 23 days later on March 13, 2013

----

Kubernetes
==========

* Container orchestration
* Automating deployment and scaling
* Abstracts computing and storage resources
* Developer provides application as an OS image
* IT operations provide resources
* Supported by many cloud platform providers

----

Private cloud for teaching
==========================

* Information security
* Some level of secrecy required for student solutions
* Ensures low latencies
* Requires a good DevOps skills from IT team

----

CS Kubernetes
=============

Provides MOOC-Grader and Jupyter Hub for CS

* 3x schedulers: 4-32 CPU, 4-128 GB RAM
* 2x workers: 32 CPU, 128GB RAM
* 2x workers: 16 CPU, 64 GB RAM

----

* Containers solve scaling..
* But require somewhat microservice design from the application



----



:data-y: r-2000
:data-x: r0

1. Platform to provide robustness and scale
2. **Software design to support scale and extensibility**
3. DevOps to course material production
4. Tools and automation to support IT operations

----

:data-y: r2000
:data-x: r0

It was easy..
=============

* Desktop apps are simple problem, download and run
* Django apps are also simple, ``git clone && ./manage.py runserver``
* A lot of users
  ‚Üí add more cores and RAM

----

:data-y: r0
:data-x: r-600

What if there is 10k users, 100k or 1M?
=======================================

----

Scalability from microservices
==============================

* Containers are light-weight "virtual machines"
  ‚Üí ideal for microservices
* Interfaces between components
  ‚Üí high availability per component
  ‚Üí robustness
* Automatic scaling per component
  ‚Üí identify problematic components

----

Distribute development
======================

* Implement features as services
  ‚Üí extensibility due common interfaces
* Separate teams can work on different components
* Separation requires problem handling and testing
  ‚Üí robustness and better software!
* Failed separation results in a house of cards
  ‚Üí problem in one service brings everything down

----

Downsides..
===========

* "What is part of a release?"
* "How do I install this?"
* "Feature X doesn't work on my machine."
* "We would need 10 virtual machines to set this up"



----



:data-y: r-2000

4. Tools and automation to support IT operations

----

:data-y: r2000

DevOps
======

* Closes the cap between development and IT operations
* Continuous Integration, i.e. git + automated tests
* Continuous Deployment, i.e. update production on a release push
* Supports agile software development, containers and microservices

----

:data-y: r0
:data-x: r-600

Digitalisation in teaching
==========================

* First, teachers wrote material with latex and exported pdf.
  Nice documents for the student to read offline.
  No interactive elements.

* Then, they clicked in moodle and wrote text boxes.
  Interactive elements!
  Often a single release and no rollbacks.

----

DevOps for teaching
===================

* Course material written in some source format
* ... or use WYSIWYG editor for it
* Text and exercises from different people
* Push material to version control for a release
* Integration tests begin ‚Üí "Did I break exercises?"
* Automated deployment to test and production environments!

----

Why?
====

* Ensure material in production is not broken
* Create multiple releases: eBook vs. course
* Deploy to multiple platforms: A+, TIM, ACOS
* Hide microservice design from the teacher
* Material cooperation between authors

Industry tools
==============

* Release services via image repositories: `Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com>`_, `Google Container Registry <https://gcr.io>`_
* Software definitions as Helm charts: `helm.sh <https://helm.sh>`_
* Cluster deployment using Helmsman: `github <https://github.com/Praqma/helmsman>`_


----

:data-y: r0
:data-x: r-600

Separation of roles
===================

* Developer produces the software and defines execution environment
* IT operations ensures computing and storage resources
* No need for ops to develop or devs to operate
* Except all the DevOps building all the images üòÅ


----

:data-rotate: r-90
:data-y: r-600
:data-x: r-600

Vision for the future
=====================

* no need to care about platform used by students
* material can be distributed via multiple platforms
* teacher creates only part of the material
* availability of interactive elements and exercises
* teacher has visibility over what is working

----

:data-rotate: r0
:data-x: r0
:data-y: r200

Teacher has time to provide best of the world learning experience,
as the tools are so awesome!

|

Teacher has analytics and feedback to make it event better!

----

IT operators can maintain 99.9% service level!

|

Students are happy as they can read to exams..

----

We do not implement same features over and over again...

----

:data-x: r1200
:data-y: r0

Underway
========

* Roman - define how material is build (i.e. Makefile)
* Shepherd - CI/CD tool for teaching (i.e. easy to use Gitlab CI / drone.io)
* helmsman and deployment tools for IT

----

:data-x: r0
:data-y: r200

To plan
=======

* ACOS as an exercise catalog and a proxy
* distributed container grader (i.e. MOOC-Grader v2)
* A+ v2
